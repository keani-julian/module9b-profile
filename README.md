# Module 9B - Custom Profile Component
REPO LINK: https://github.com/keani-julian/module9b-profile

## Description
This is a React app built with Vite. It contains a profile component styled entirely with inline CSS. The component displays a user's circular profile image, name, and a short bio.

## What I Learned
- How to use JSX to structure content
- How to style React components using inline CSS
- How to create, export, and render functional components
- How to organize a React app with Vite

## Challenges
I initially encountered a blank screen because of an incorrect export/import in `UserProfile.jsx`. Correcting the `export default UserProfile;` line and making sure `App.jsx` imports it properly resolved the issue.
